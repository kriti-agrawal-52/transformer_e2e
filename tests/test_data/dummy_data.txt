This is a small dataset for testing purposes.
It contains just enough text to test tokenization and batching.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
He found his art never won acceptance.
She advised him to take a long holiday.
The sky is blue and the sun is bright.
Never underestimate the power of a good book.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All the world's a stage.
And all the men and women merely players.
They have their exits and their entrances.
And one man in his time plays many parts.
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant.
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel.
And shining morning face, creeping like snail.
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover.
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad.
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier.
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard.
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel.
Seeking the bubble reputation.
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice.
In fair round belly with good capon lined.
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut.
Full of wise saws and modern instances.
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts.
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon.
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side.
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide.
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice.
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes.
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all.
That ends this strange eventful history.
Is second childishness and mere oblivion.
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
The end.
