# Changelog

<!--
WHAT IS A CHANGELOG?
===================
A changelog is a file that documents all notable changes made to a project.
It helps users and developers understand what changed between versions.

WHY USE A CHANGELOG?
===================
- Users know what new features are available
- Developers track what changed between releases
- Easy to understand version history
- Helps with debugging (when did a bug appear?)
- Shows project progress and activity

CHANGELOG FORMAT GUIDE:
======================
- [version] - Date: Release information
- Added: New features
- Changed: Changes to existing features
- Deprecated: Features that will be removed soon
- Removed: Features that were removed
- Fixed: Bug fixes
- Security: Security improvements

VERSION NUMBERING (Semantic Versioning):
=======================================
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3)
- MAJOR: Breaking changes (incompatible API changes)
- MINOR: New features (backwards compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes (backwards compatible)

Examples:
- 0.1.0 → 0.1.1: Bug fix (patch)
- 0.1.1 → 0.2.0: New feature (minor)
- 0.2.0 → 1.0.0: Breaking change (major)
-->

## [0.1.0]

<!--
This is your first version (v0.1.0).
The "0" major version indicates this is still in development/beta.
We'll increment to 1.0.0 when the API is stable and production-ready.
-->

### Added

#### Core Training Infrastructure

<!-- Training is the heart of your ML pipeline -->

- **Custom Transformer Architecture**: Decoder-only transformer with configurable layers, heads, and dimensions
  <!-- Your main model - similar to GPT architecture -->
- **Advanced Training Loop**: Training with validation, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling
  <!-- Smart training that stops when model stops improving -->
- **Smart Checkpoint Management**: Automatic saving, loading, and resumption of interrupted training
  <!-- Never lose training progress due to crashes -->
- **Hyperparameter Search**: Grid search capabilities with W&B integration
  <!-- Automatically find the best model settings -->
- **Dynamic Dropout**: Progressive dropout rates from lowest to highest layers
  <!-- Your unique regularization strategy to prevent overfitting -->

#### Data Pipeline

<!-- How your model gets and processes data -->

- **WikiText-2 Integration**: Automatic dataset loading and preprocessing
  <!-- Standard text dataset for language modeling -->
- **GPT-2 Tokenization**: Compatible tokenizer for text processing
  <!-- Breaks text into tokens the model can understand -->
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient data loading with configurable batch sizes and context windows
  <!-- Process multiple examples at once for efficiency -->

#### MLOps Infrastructure

<!-- The "Ops" part - making ML work in production -->

- **W&B Integration**: Comprehensive experiment tracking, metrics logging, and artifact management
  <!-- Weights & Biases - tracks all your experiments -->
- **Configuration Management**: YAML-based configuration with environment variable support
  <!-- Easy way to change settings without changing code -->
- **Completion Tracking**: Smart run completion detection to prevent duplicate training
  <!-- Knows when training is done, won't restart accidentally -->
- **Model Artifacts**: Automatic model upload to W&B with metadata
  <!-- Saves trained models in the cloud with all relevant info -->

#### Testing & Quality

<!-- Ensuring your code works reliably -->

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Unit, integration, smoke, and e2e tests
  <!-- Different types of tests catch different types of bugs -->
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing
  <!-- Automatically runs tests when you push code -->
- **Code Quality**: Black formatting, Flake8 linting, and type checking setup
  <!-- Keeps code clean and readable -->
- **Test Categories**: Organized test structure for different testing scenarios
  <!-- Tests are organized by what they're testing -->

#### Developer Experience

<!-- Making life easier for developers (including you!) -->

- **Smart Resumption**: Automatic detection and resumption of interrupted training
  <!-- Training can continue where it left off after interruption -->
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging with both file and console output
  <!-- Detailed information about what's happening -->
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with custom exceptions
  <!-- Helpful error messages when things go wrong -->
- **Documentation**: Detailed README and training documentation
  <!-- Instructions for using the system -->

### Architecture Decisions

<!-- Important design choices made in this version -->

- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns for models, training, data, and utilities
  <!-- Each part has a specific job, making code easier to maintain -->
- **Package Structure**: Proper Python package with entry points and dependencies
  <!-- Can be installed like any other Python package -->

### Configuration Features

<!-- How users can customize the system -->

- **Training Hyperparameters**: Configurable batch size, learning rate, model dimensions
  <!-- Users can tune these for their specific needs -->
- **Training Management**: Early stopping, validation frequency, dropout strategies
  <!-- Control how training behaves -->
- **System Settings**: Device selection, checkpoint directories, W&B project settings
  <!-- Configure where things run and where files are saved -->
- **Data Settings**: Dataset selection, text limits, tokenizer configuration
  <!-- Configure what data to use and how to process it -->

### Model Capabilities

<!-- What your trained model can do -->

- **Text Generation**: Generate text from trained models with configurable parameters
  <!-- The main output - generating human-like text -->
- **Model Architecture**: 8-layer, 8-head transformer with 512 channel dimensions
  <!-- Technical specs of your current model -->
- **Context Processing**: 256-token context window with positional embeddings
  <!-- How much text the model can "remember" at once -->
- **Regularization**: Advanced dropout strategy and weight decay
  <!-- Techniques to prevent overfitting -->
